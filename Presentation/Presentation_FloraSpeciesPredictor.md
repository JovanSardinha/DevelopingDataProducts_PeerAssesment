Background & Purpose of this Project
========================================================

**Background:**
The American botanist Edgar Anderson meticulously collected data on three species of iris in the early 1930s. Since then, the data set (or one of its variations) has been used to test hundreds, if not thousands, of machine learning algorithms.

Why has the iris data set become so popular? Fisher's selecting it to illustrate a discrimination algorithm brought it to peoples attention, and the fact that the data set contains three classes, only one of which is linearly separable from the other two, makes it interesting.


**Purpose:**
To build a web application that allows users to get a prediction for a flora species based on entered specifications in line with the Iris dataset.
